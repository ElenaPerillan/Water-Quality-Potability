# Water-Quality-Potability
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the potability of water based on various physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters. Ensuring water quality is crucial for public health, and this model aims to assist in the rapid and accurate determination of water safety.

Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises a set of water quality parameters collected from various water sources. Each sample is labeled as potable (safe to drink) or non-potable (unsafe to drink). The key features in the dataset include:

pH: Indicates the acidity or alkalinity of the water.
Hardness: Measures the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions.
Solids (Total Dissolved Solids): Indicates the total amount of dissolved substances in water.
Chloramines: Represents the level of disinfectants used in water treatment.
Sulfate: A measure of sulfate ions in water.
Conductivity: Reflects the water's ability to conduct electrical current, correlated with ion concentration.
Organic Carbon (Total Organic Carbon): Amount of organic matter present in water.
Trihalomethanes: Byproducts of water chlorination that can be harmful at high levels.
Turbidity: Measures the clarity of water, indicating potential pathogen presence.
Potability: The target variable indicating whether water is safe to drink (1) or not (0).
